## 🔥 Introduction:

A very simple fetcher for COVID19 statistics offered by the Robert-Koch-Institut (RKI) in Germany. 

1⃣ Select your `district`
2⃣ Check the latest information about your surrounding
3⃣ Share the information with your friends, family or coworkers

## 🔧 Usage:

Add the following line to your HTML:

```html
<script src="cdn.bestofcode.net/rkifetch"></script>
```

Instantiate a new RKIFetcher:

```javascript 
const rkiFetcher = new RKIFetcher();
```

You have the following options to manipulate the instance during instantiation:

```javascript
const rkiFetcher = new RKIFetcher({city: "Düsseldorf", mode: "detailed"})
```

There are several other options to use (in the future).
