3Ô∏è‚É£ `SHARE` the information with your friends, family or coworkers

## üîß Usage:

Add the following line to your HTML:

```html
<script src="cdn.bestofcode.net/rkifetch"></script>
```

Instantiate a new RKIFetcher:

You have the following options to manipulate the instance during instantiation:
